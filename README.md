# MeatScape Adventure

### Meet the Meat! Play as Meatman!

* Roll, glide, and bounce around a large open world, specially designed to help Meatman move!  
* Collect Meatshank tokens scattered around the world in order to unlock some dapper hats for Meatman  
* The Elf circus is in town! Have fun interacting with the attractions and you may be rewarded with more tokens
But be careful not to overexert Meatman, you wouldn't like Meatman hungry...

## A note from the developers

This is a demo of what was supposed to be a much larger game.
After over a year of development (twice as long as we wanted to spend on it), and many pivots (some of which completely changed the game), we decided we needed to take a break from the project.
This demo is meant to showcase the part of the game that had the most hours put into it (and ended up being good), the movement mechanics. Please enjoy.
